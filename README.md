# bookstore-client

Coding along with [Frank Treacy](https://github.com/frank06). Frank is awesome for many reasons, but especially because he's committed to keeping his Ember tutorials up-to-date. Check them out at [Ember Igniter](http://emberigniter.com).

This client is built primarily by following along with [Building a UI Around an Ember 2.0 Data App](http://emberigniter.com/building-user-interface-around-ember-data-app/), with a little bit more from [Building a modern bridge between Ember 2.0 and Rails 5 with JSON API](http://emberigniter.com/modern-bridge-ember-and-rails-5-with-json-api/).

## Installation

Clone this repository.

Install dependencies with `npm install && bower install`.

Run the client server with `ember server`. If you want to work with [the API](https://github.com/jrhorn424/bookstore-api), make sure it is up and running and use `ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000`, instead.
